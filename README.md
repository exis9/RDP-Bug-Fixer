# Microsoft Remote Desktop (Windows App) is really buggy!
Whenerver you use Remote Desktop (aka Windows App), you would very often encounter sudden audio death and clipboard death.

So...! This app can fix the Top 2 most annoying bugs:

```"The audio mute(no sound) bug"``` and ```"The Clipboard(Ctrl+C or Command+C) disable bug"```.

# What is this?

The idea is really simple. There are just two buttons:


â–  The "Reboot WindowAudio" button will fix the RDP audio system.

â–  The "Reboot Remote Clipboard" button will fix the RDP clipboard system.


Both can fix the annoying issues without RDP or Windows rebooting!
